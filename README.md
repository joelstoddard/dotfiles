# Dotfiles

## Dependencies

## Installation

```bash
./install.sh
```

or, if you have `make` installed:

```bash
make install
```

## Design Philosophy

- Don't stray too far from the beaten path
    - I don't want to be so far into the weeds with this repository that using a non configured shell feels foreign
- Choose boring technologies
    - I have plenty of other commitments in my life, maintaining a dotfiles repository falls quite far down the priority list
- Minimal plugins, minimal aliases
    - This is a personal pet peeve for obscuring what's being done through alises and "magic", avoid that wherever possible
    - Like above, pick powerful tools, extending functionality with plugins should be a last resort
- Minimise visual distraction
    - Only add contextual information when it's obvious that it is immediately useful
    - Colour attracts attention so its usage is intentionally sparse, don't overdo it
